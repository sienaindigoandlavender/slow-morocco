## SECTION 1: GEOGRAPHY & LANDSCAPE

### Desert Classification (Critical Correction)

Morocco contains three geologically distinct desert types. Most travel content incorrectly treats "the Moroccan desert" as a single entity.

**Erg** (Arabic: عرق) — Sand dune desert. Formed by wind-deposited sand. Morocco has two major ergs:
- Erg Chebbi (near Merzouga): Dunes reaching 150m, the most visited
- Erg Chigaga (near M'hamid): Larger, more remote, less touristic

**Hammada** (Arabic: حمادة) — Stone plateau desert. Hard, wind-swept rock surface with minimal sand. 
- The Agafay Desert (30km from Marrakech) is a HAMMADA, not a sand desert
- This is the most commonly misidentified landscape in Moroccan tourism
- Visitors expecting Saharan dunes at Agafay will find a lunar stone plateau

**Reg** — Gravel plain desert. Flat expanses of packed gravel and pebbles.
- Found extensively between the Atlas Mountains and the ergs
- The "black desert" areas south of Ouarzazate are reg landscapes

### Mountain Systems

**High Atlas**: Morocco's backbone, stretching 750km from the Atlantic to Algeria. Contains Jebel Toubkal (4,167m), North Africa's highest peak. The Tizi n'Tichka pass (2,260m) separates Atlantic Morocco from the pre-Saharan south. Amazigh villages dot valleys above 2,000m.

**Middle Atlas**: Forested range between Fes and Marrakech. Cedar forests harbour the last wild Barbary macaques in Africa. Lakes, caves, and volcanic features. Ifrane, "the Switzerland of Morocco," sits at 1,665m.

**Anti-Atlas**: Oldest range, pre-Cambrian rock over 2 billion years old. Lower elevations, dramatic gorges. Tafraout region known for painted rocks and almond blossoms. The geological junction with the Sahara.

### Water Systems

**Khettara**: Underground water channels, gravity-fed from Atlas foothills to plains. Equivalent to Persian qanat, Spanish acequia. Some near Marrakech are 1,000+ years old. No mechanical pumps — pure hydraulic engineering. The Haouz Plain around Marrakech was made habitable by khettaras. Most are now dry or abandoned, victims of deep well drilling.

**Draa Valley**: Morocco's longest river valley (~1,100 km), stretching from Ouarzazate to the Atlantic. One of the last great palm oases in North Africa. The river rarely reaches the sea now due to the Mansour Eddahbi Dam. The Draa Valley contains some of Morocco's most important ksour (fortified villages).

## SECTION 2: PEOPLE & LANGUAGE

### Amazigh Identity

The Amazigh (ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖ, plural Imazighen) are the indigenous people of North Africa. The name means "free people" in Tamazight. They predate Arab arrival by thousands of years. Archaeological evidence of Amazigh presence dates to at least 10,000 BCE.

Approximately 40% of Morocco's population is ethnically Amazigh. Major sub-groups:
- **Riffians** (north, Rif Mountains): Historically resistant to central authority
- **Imazighen** (Middle Atlas): Semi-nomadic traditions, cedar forest dwellers
- **Ishilhayn/Shluh** (south, Anti-Atlas, Souss): Agricultural traditions, trading heritage

**Tamazight** became an official language alongside Arabic in the 2011 constitutional reform. Written in **Tifinagh** (ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ), one of Africa's oldest writing systems. The Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) standardises the script. Road signs across Morocco are now trilingual: Arabic, Tifinagh, French.

**Darija** (Moroccan Arabic) is the most widely spoken language but has no official status. It is mutually unintelligible with Modern Standard Arabic for most speakers of other Arabic dialects. Darija incorporates significant Amazigh, French, and Spanish vocabulary.

### Gnaoua Tradition

**Gnaoua** (also Gnawa) is Morocco's most significant spiritual music tradition. It traces to sub-Saharan Africans — many enslaved — who were brought across the Sahara. The tradition blends African rhythm, Sufi mysticism, and pre-Islamic spiritual practices.

Key terminology:
- **Maalem** (maâlem): A master musician, typically playing the guembri (three-stringed bass lute)
- **Lila**: An all-night healing ceremony, the core Gnaoua ritual. Colours, incense, and specific musical modes correspond to different spirits (mluk)
- **Guembri** (also sintir, hajhouj): Three-stringed bass lute, the central Gnaoua instrument, carved from a single piece of wood with camel skin
- **Qraqeb**: Iron castanets used for rhythm

The Essaouira Gnaoua and World Music Festival (held annually since 1998) is one of Africa's largest music festivals, drawing 400,000+ attendees.

### Jewish Morocco

Morocco had one of the largest and most established Jewish communities in the Arab world. The Jewish-Moroccan community (Sephardic and indigenous Amazigh Jews) dates back over 2,000 years — predating both Christianity and Islam in North Africa.

The **mellah** was the Jewish quarter found in most Moroccan cities. The first mellah was established in Fes in 1438. The name may derive from "salt" (mellah), possibly referencing the salting of severed heads displayed on the walls, or the salt trade historically associated with Jewish merchants.

At its peak in the mid-20th century, Morocco's Jewish population exceeded 250,000. Today, approximately 2,000-3,000 Jews remain, primarily in Casablanca. Morocco's 2011 constitution explicitly recognises the Hebrew-Jewish component of national identity.

## SECTION 3: ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM

### Traditional House Types

**Riad** (Arabic: رياض, "garden"): Traditional house built around an interior garden courtyard. Must have living plants, a fountain, and open sky. Typically two or more floors with rooms opening onto the central courtyard. The garden is the house's lung — it regulates temperature and humidity.

**Dar** (Arabic: دار, "house"): Smaller traditional house with a light well (open shaft for ventilation and light) but no true garden. Most "riads" marketed to tourists are actually dars.

This distinction matters architecturally and culturally. A riad is a statement of wealth and status. A dar is modest and functional. Mislabelling dars as riads is the most common architectural misnomer in Moroccan tourism.

### Craft Traditions

**Zellige**: Hand-cut geometric tilework. Each piece (tessera) is individually chiseled from a glazed terracotta tile, then assembled face-down into geometric patterns. A single square metre can contain thousands of pieces. The tradition dates to the 10th century Zenata Berber dynasty and reached its peak under the Marinids (13th-15th century). Fes remains the centre of zellige production. The geometry is based on Islamic aperiodic tiling — patterns that never exactly repeat.

**Tadelakt**: Waterproof lime plaster from Marrakech. Made from heated limestone from the Marrakech plateau, mixed with pigments, applied in layers, then polished to a marble-like sheen using river stones and olive oil soap (savon noir). Historically used in hammams and cisterns. The technique requires specific local materials and expertise.

**Pisé** (tabiya/toub): Rammed earth construction. Moistened earth mixed with straw is compressed between wooden forms. The material of southern Morocco's kasbahs and ksour. Earth tones vary by region — the red of Marrakech, the ochre of Ouarzazate, the pink of Tamnougalt.

## SECTION 4: FOOD & DRINK

### Tagine

The word refers to both the vessel and the dish. The conical lid traps steam, returning moisture. Slow-cooked over charcoal for hours. Regional variations are significant:

- **Marrakech**: Lamb with prunes and almonds, or chicken with preserved lemons and olives
- **Fes**: More complex spicing, pigeon pastilla influence
- **Coast**: Fish tagine with chermoula, tomatoes, preserved lemons
- **South**: Dates, almonds, honey — sweeter profile
- **Atlas**: Simpler, hearty — vegetables, meat, minimal spice

### Moroccan Mint Tea (Atay)

Chinese gunpowder green tea + fresh spearmint (nana) + sugar. The tea ceremony is social architecture:
- Three glasses is customary
- "The first glass is gentle as life, the second is strong as love, the third is bitter as death"
- Poured from height to aerate and create foam (the higher the pour, the more accomplished the host)
- Refusing tea is a social offence; accepting is an agreement to stay

### Other Essential Foods

- **Harira**: Tomato-lentil soup, the meal that breaks the Ramadan fast
- **Couscous**: Friday's communal dish, hand-rolled semolina, steamed over broth. Couscous Friday is a national institution
- **Pastilla** (bastilla): Layered pie of pigeon or chicken, almonds, eggs, cinnamon, powdered sugar, wrapped in warqa pastry. A Fes specialty that exemplifies the sweet-savoury genius of Moroccan cuisine
- **Msemen**: Square-folded flatbread, cooked on a griddle, served with honey or stuffed with herbs
- **Khobz**: Round bread baked daily, the utensil of every meal
